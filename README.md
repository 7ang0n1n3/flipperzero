# Custom Firmwares #

There are a few out there, these two are pretty stable.
(Personally use RougeMaster)
The offical firmware is region locked due to local regulations.
Custom firmware unlocks that restriction.

# Notes #

When installing or upgrading the firmware. 
Recommend using a blank MicroSD. Just backup
the existing card and re-format.
